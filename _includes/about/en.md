Hey, I am Yuandi Tang. I just graduated from [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu).

I consider myself a marketing professional with seven years of experience who is now transitioning to a data track role. I have honed my marketing strategy, campaign management, and customer engagement skills throughout my career, and I am excited to leverage my expertise in a data-driven capacity.

With a strong foundation in marketing, I have witnessed firsthand the power of data in driving successful campaigns and informed decision-making. The ability to extract actionable insights from data has become a critical component of marketing effectiveness, and I am eager to contribute my knowledge and experience to this evolving field.

Over the course of my career, I have successfully planned and executed comprehensive marketing campaigns, utilizing various channels to reach target audiences and achieve measurable results. I have demonstrated proficiency in leveraging analytics tools and platforms to evaluate campaign performance, identify areas for optimization, and make data-backed recommendations for improvement.

My passion for data analysis and its impact on marketing outcomes has led me to pursue a transition into a data track role. I am eager to apply my analytical skills, strategic mindset, and understanding of marketing dynamics to extract meaningful insights from data sets, conduct thorough market research, and uncover valuable trends and patterns that can shape effective marketing strategies.

In addition to my marketing background, I have developed strong technical skills in data analysis tools, such as Excel, SQL, and data visualization platforms. I am comfortable working with large datasets, conducting statistical analyses, and presenting findings in a clear and actionable manner.

I thrive in collaborative environments and am skilled at cross-functional communication, collaborating with diverse teams to achieve shared objectives. My ability to bridge the gap between marketing and data analytics positions me well to contribute to the success of data-driven initiatives and align marketing strategies with business goals.

As a person communicator, I understand the power of effective communication in establishing meaningful connections and fostering positive relationships. Throughout my career, I have honed my interpersonal skills to build rapport with clients, stakeholders, and team members. I pride myself on my ability to listen attentively, empathize with others, and adapt my communication style to different audiences. I believe that open and transparent communication is the foundation for successful collaborations and achieving shared goals.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I have developed a deep passion for cooking Chinese food. Growing up in China, I was exposed to Chinese cuisines and flavors from an early age. Cooking has become a way for me to express my creativity and a means of preserving and sharing my cultural heritage. I find joy in exploring new recipes, experimenting with ingredients, and creating dishes that bring people together. Cooking allows me to connect with others through the universal language of food and to share my love for Chinese culinary traditions.

In addition to my love for cooking, I am deeply committed to advancing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. I firmly believe that diverse perspectives and inclusive practices lead to innovation and a stronger sense of community. I actively seek opportunities to contribute personally and professionally to DEI efforts. I was the professional Chair of the [COM Grad Council](https://www.instagram.com/bucomgrad/), still a volunteer of [Cradles to Crayons](https://www.cradlestocrayons.org/), [GBFB](https://www.gbfb.org/),[Boston Cares](https://www.bostoncares.org/),[Pan Mass Challenge](pmc.org) and [NAAAP Boston](https://www.naaapboston.org/). Whether advocating for equitable practices within the workplace or engaging in community initiatives, I am dedicated to fostering environments where everyone feels valued and heard.

Glad to know you and hope to connect with you soon!
